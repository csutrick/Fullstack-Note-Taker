# Fullstack-Note-Taker

This full stack website allows user to create notes with titles and content. Using express.js for the backend which saves and retrieves data from a JSON file. This projects as simple front end UI as i was focused on the backend side of this project.

## Usages

The website is pretty simple as you just have to enter a title and its contents and then press the little save button in the top right hand corner, this saves it to the database. Now if you check db/db.json you should see your note contents in the file. I didnt finish the delete button but for future devolpment i would like to add that feature as i feel its missing that important feature.
